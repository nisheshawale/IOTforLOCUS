### Objective
- To create a system where the patient can send their health related data (here, ECG data is used) from sensor to a doctor for checkup over the internet for remote health care.

### Problems
- Doctor to population ratio in rural areas of Nepal = 1:150000
- Difficult for disabled and elderly people to visit hospital regularly.
- People do not have spare time to visit hospital for their regular health check-up.
- Carrying all the previous medical records for health check-up is tedious for a person.

## Literature Review
- Pilot program was launched in Gulmi District of Nepal where health workers were provided with a free phone number to call three General Practitioner Doctors in the District Hospital.
- In some district hospitals of Nepal, an Internet connection, computer and camera is provided so that they can request a hospital in Kathmandu for consultations on medical problems.

### Proposed Solution
![solution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29419943/70080836-68751900-162f-11ea-9810-29d1103a0949.png)

### Tools and Technologies Used
##### Hardware
1. NodeMCU
- Microcontroller with built-in wifi-module.
- Programming can be done in Arduino IDE.
- It is used to send ECG data to web server in this project.
2. ECG sensor (AD8232)
- It measures electrical activity of the heart.
- Data obtained from it can be used to plot ECG graph.
- Patientâ€™s data obtained from this sensor is sent to NodeMCU.
##### Software
1. Django
- Python based web framework
- Used for backend development
2. HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap
- Used for frontend development
3. MySQL
- Used for database management
4. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Used for hosting website
5. Arduino IDE
- Used for programming NodeMCU
### Prototyping on Breadboard

### Final PCB

### Website to provide recommendations to the patient by the doctor.

### Demonstration of the project in a national technological festival.

### ECG graph after using exponential smoothing in the data.(Parameters of exponential smoothing were tuned manually.)

### Further Work
- Later, we used a deep convolutional neural network to classify irregular heartbeats obtained from ECG sensor data.
- The model architecture was taken from a research paper[1] and trained on our dataset.
- It was able to classify five different classes of arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat).

### Conclusion
- We were successful in building a system that can transfer ECG data coming from sensor over the internet for remote health care. Later, we also trained a convolutional neural network to classify five different classes of arrhythmia.
